The Climate Impacts: Global and Regional Adaptation Support Platform (ci:grasp) is a web-based climate information service. It aims to support decision makers in developing and emerging countries to prioritise adaptation needs, and to plan and implement appropriate adaptation measures.

ci:grasp is structured based on impact chains, which demonstrate how a given climate stimulus propagates through a system of interest via the direct and indirect impacts it entails. 

ci:grasp was developed at Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research in cooperation with <a href="https://www.giz.de/de/html/index.html">GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit)</a>
