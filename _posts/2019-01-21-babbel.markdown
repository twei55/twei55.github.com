<p>Babbel's online language learning app empowers learners to start speaking a new language straight away. Recognised by Fast Company Magazine as the most innovative education company of 2016, Babbel's courses make it easy to learn 14 different languages from 7 display languages. Babbel's language learning app is available for web, iOS and Android. The company recently surpassed 1,000,000 active subscribers and has a team of over 600 people from over 50 nations working in Berlin and New York.<p>
<p>Over the last 6 years I took over substantial duties in the refactoring of Babbel's static content delivery pipeline, payment services and the redesign of the platform.</p>
